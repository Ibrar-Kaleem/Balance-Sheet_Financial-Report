# Balance-Sheet_Financial-Report

<h2>Description</h2>
The project is regarding creating a Balance sheet of a company 

<br />

<h2>Interactive Balance Sheets</h2>
Power BI transforms static balance sheets into interactive dashboards. This allows users to drill down into specific assets, liabilities, or equity accounts to understand their composition and trends over time.

<br />

<h2>Real-Time Updates</h2> 
With Power BI, balance sheets can be updated in real-time as data flows in from connected sources. This ensures that decision-makers always have the most current snapshot of the company's financial position.

<br />

<h2>Predictive Capabilities</h2>
Power BI's integration with AI tools can be used to forecast future balance sheet positions based on historical trends and patterns. This can help businesses anticipate future financial needs and make proactive decisions.

B.1) Calculating Balance Sheet Values:
<br />
<br />
BS values =CALCULATE( SUM('Balance Sheet Data'[balance Sheet Values]),TREATAS(VALUES(Dates[Year]),'Balance Sheet Data'[Year])
<br /> -- TREATAS used to avoid connecting date table with Balance sheet table
<br /> -- Values function used create a table with required dates
<br />-- Calculate function used for removing the filter level context

<br />
<br />
B.2)	Current Assets : Current Assets = CALCULATE([BS values],'Balance Sheet Data'[Category]= "Current assets")
<br />
<br />
B.3)	Current Liabilities : Current Liabilities = CALCULATE([BS values],'Balance Sheet Data'[Category]= "Current liabilities")
<br />
<br />
B.4)	Fixed Assets: Fixed Assets = CALCULATE([BS values],'Balance Sheet Data'[Category]= "Fixed (Long-Term) Assets")
<br />
<br />
B.5)	Liabilities and owners equity: Liabilities and owners Equity = [Current Liabilities]+[Long-Term Liabilities]+[Owner's Equity]
<br />
<br />
B.6)	Long term Liabilities: Long-Term Liabilities = CALCULATE([BS values],'Balance Sheet Data'[Category]= "Long-Term Liabilities")
<br />
<br />
B.7)	Other Assets: Other Assets = CALCULATE([BS values],'Balance Sheet Data'[Category]= "Other Assets")
<br />
<br />
B.8)	Ownersâ€™ Equity: Owner's Equity = CALCULATE([BS values],'Balance Sheet Data'[Category]= "Owner's Equity")
<br />
<br />
B.9)	Total Assets: Total Assets = [Current Assets]+[Fixed Assets]+[Other Assets]
<br />
<br />
B.10)	Total Liabilities: Total Liabilities = [Current Liabilities]+[Long-Term Liabilities]
<br />
<br />
B.11)	Balance sheet all Roll-up values: 
<br />
B/S values = 
Var currentitem = SELECTEDVALUE('Balance Sheet Template'[Balance Sheet Normalized])
<br />
Return
